# NinjDiff

Implementation of the bindiff algorithm and heuristics for the Binary Ninja platform.
This project aims to compare 2 files in-memory, without the use of an external DB - This makes the comparison process extremely slow.

A new fork of this project will be created in order to implement the same heuristics, only using Neo4j Graph DB to speed up the matching process.
